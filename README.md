## Introduction
This project aims to create a digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. Each image is associated with a label from 0 to 9.

You can download the MNIST dataset from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
